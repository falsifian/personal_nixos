        This option allows you to override the Linux kernel used by
        NixOS.  Since things like external kernel module packages are
        tied to the kernel you're using, it also overrides those.
        This option is a function that takes Nixpkgs as an argument
        (as a convenience), and returns an attribute set containing at
        the very least an attribute <varname>kernel</varname>.
        Additional attributes may be needed depending on your
        configuration.  For instance, if you use the NVIDIA X driver,
        then it also needs to contain an attribute
        <varname>nvidia_x11</varname>.

        The set of kernel modules in the initial ramdisk used during the
        boot process.  This set must include all modules necessary for
        mounting the root device.  That is, it should include modules
        for the physical device (e.g., SCSI drivers) and for the file
        system (e.g., ext3).  The set specified here is automatically
        closed under the module dependency relation, i.e., all
        dependencies of the modules list here are included
        automatically.  The modules listed here are available in the
        initrd, but are only loaded on demand (e.g., the ext3 module is
        loaded automatically when an ext3 filesystem is mounted, and
        modules for PCI devices are loaded when they match the PCI ID
        of a device in your system).  To force a module to be loaded,
        include it in <option>boot.initrd.kernelModules</option>.
